## Project Description

This project is a website designed to provide information about the Legion of Templars which is based on my IMAGINATION. This serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in various web development skills including Flexbox and Grid for layout design, HTML Inputs for user interaction, CSS Animation and Transitions for dynamic visual effects, Media Query for responsive design, and JavaScript for DOM Manipulation. The project also highlights my adeptness in handling JavaScript's AddEventListener, Arrays, and Object Methods to create interactive and dynamic web content.

The website is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, providing a seamless experience for visitors. It features a clean layout, intuitive navigation, and responsive design, ensuring it looks great on all devices.

While this is my first project, it's far from my last. I'm excited to continue learning, improving, and creating more complex and dynamic websites in the future.
